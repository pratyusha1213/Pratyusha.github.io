					<h3>Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage</h3>
					<h5>Data Analytics and Visualization Project</h5>
					<p>In May 2024, I completed the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage, where I engaged in a comprehensive project for a hypothetical social media client. 
						During this simulation, I honed my skills in data cleaning, modeling, and analysis, ensuring that the data was accurate and ready for insightful examination. 
						I leveraged advanced analytical techniques to uncover trends and patterns that could drive strategic decisions. Furthermore, I developed and presented clear, compelling visualizations and reports that communicated these insights effectively, demonstrating my ability to translate complex data into actionable business strategies.</p>

					<h3>Research on Application of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education</h3>
					<h5>Data Management Project</h5>
					<p>In my final year, I undertook a significant research project on the application of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education, particularly focusing on distance learning. 
						The project, spanning from December 2019 to May 2020, involved developing an Operational Data Management application using Python and Django. 
						This innovative platform facilitated seamless interaction between students, trainers, and administrators, enabling efficient information sharing and knowledge exchange. 
						By leveraging AI, the project aimed to enhance the adoption of medical education technologies among healthcare providers, thereby improving patient outcomes and operational efficiency on a larger scale. 
						This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of AI's transformative potential in the healthcare sector.</p>

					<h3>Spam SMS Filtering Using Machine Learning</h3>
					<h5>Data Quality Improvement Project</h5>
					<p>In my mini project, "Spam SMS Filtering using Machine Learning," conducted from February to May 2019, I focused on enhancing data quality through real-time classification of spam SMS messages.
						The project aimed to immediately identify and filter out spam messages upon receipt on a mobile device, addressing the challenge of zero-hour attacks—newly created spam messages that traditional filters might miss. 
						By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we developed a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between legitimate and spam messages, even when encountering previously unseen spam content. 
						This project underscored the importance of adaptive and proactive spam detection mechanisms in improving communication security and user experience.</p>
